# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉

Ever wanted to do math like a boss? 😎  
This playful Python calculator helps you **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, and **divide** two numbers — with style!

## 🧠 Features
- Accepts **decimals** (thanks to `float()`)
- Performs:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Super beginner-friendly, with fun comments!

## 🛠️ How It Works

```python
# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2  # Make sure num2 isn't zero!

# Step 4: Display results
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
````

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repo or copy the code into a `.py` file.
3. Run it using:

```bash
python fun_calculator.py
```

4. Follow the prompts and enjoy the math magic! 🧙‍♂️

## 💡 Notes

* This calculator doesn't handle division by zero yet, so avoid entering `0` as the second number. 😉
* Want to improve it? Add error handling or a GUI!
